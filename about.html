    <h1>About Me<h1> Hello, I am Sam. This summer I am taking a computer science class. It is my first year in HTML and CSS but I absolutely love coding. I have used scratch and tinker to create some cool projects in java script or blocks. I chose to enroll in this summer class to learn more about computer science and learn new languages. I play soccer, so I chose a soccer ball as a logo. I want to make a soccer video game that I super popular when I am older. I might want to be a software developer when I am older, so I am trying to learn new stuff about code.
