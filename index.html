                      <p>Welcome to my computer science website. This website was created during the summer of 2017 for a computer science program I am taking. This website was made so I could showcase what I made, and use the skills I learned to make the website. If you look in my About Me page you will learn a little more about me. If you look in my Computer Science Projects you will see some of the stuff I made this summer.</p>
